# 🎨 Web created with HTML & CSS 
This website has been created to improve my skills in HTML and CSS. This is my first website! 🥳
This project only the graphic part.
It also includes a smartphone design (images below)

# 📐 Sections on the website 
* **Landing page:** This is a welcome screen inviting the user to visit the Menu.
* **Who are we?:** This section explains what the company is about and who is part of it. It also includes a video.
* **Products and services:** This section contains the restaurant menu.
* **Contact:** This section includes a map and a contact form.
* **Work with us:** This section contains a form with the necessary information to apply for a job offer.

# ❌ Things to improve
* **Responsive**: The design has been designed for smartphones but it is not suitable for all types of devices such as tablets.
* **Navigation**: The navigation bar in the mobile version can be improved incredibly.
* **Syntax**: The syntax of the HTML is poor and the names of many classes are also inadequate.

All these things will be taken into account for future projects.
